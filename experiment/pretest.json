      "question": "What are higher-order functions in Python?",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Functions that accept and/or return other functions",

        "b": "Functions that operate on lists of numbers",

        "c": "Functions that are defined inside other functions",

        "d": "Functions that are decorated with a \"@staticmethod\" decorator"
      },
       "explanations": {
                          "a": "This option is correct. Higher-order functions in Python are functions that can accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as their results. They treat functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be manipulated and used as data.",
                          "b": "This option is incorrect. While higher-order functions can operate on lists of numbers, their definition is not limited to this specific behavior. Higher-order functions can work with various types of data, not just lists of numbers.",
                          "c": "This option is incorrect. Functions that are defined inside other functions are called nested functions or inner functions. They are not necessarily higher-order functions. Higher-order functions involve the acceptance and/or return of other functions, but they can be defined at the global level as well.",
                          "d": "This option is incorrect. Static methods in Python are not necessarily higher-order functions. They are methods that belong to a class and can be called on the class itself, without requiring an instance. Higher-order functions are not directly related to the @staticmethod decorator."

    {
      "question": " Why would you want to use a higher-order function in Python?",

      "answers": {
        "a": " To make your code more complex and difficult to read",

        "b": "To save time when writing code",

        "c": " To make your code more modular and easier to maintain",

        "d": " To avoid using built-in Python functions"
      },
       "explanations": {
                          "a": "This option is incorrect. The purpose of using higher-order functions is not to make the code more complex or difficult to read. Higher-order functions can actually help simplify and organize code by promoting modularity and reusability.",
                          "b": "This option is partially correct. Higher-order functions can save time when writing code by providing reusable patterns and abstractions. They allow you to abstract away common operations into functions, reducing the amount of repetitive code you need to write.",
                          "c": "This option is correct. One of the main advantages of using higher-order functions is that they promote modularity and improve code maintainability. By abstracting common operations into separate functions, you can modularize your code and make it easier to understand, test, and update.",
                          "d": "This option is incorrect. Higher-order functions are not used to avoid built-in Python functions. In fact, higher-order functions often work in conjunction with built-in functions to provide more flexibility and customization in code implementation."

    {
      "question": "In the context of higher-order functions, what is a call back function?",

      "answers": {
        "a": "A function that is called only once ",

        "b": "A function that is called by another function",

        "c": "A function that is defined inside another function ",

        "d": "None of the above"
      },
       "explanations": {
                        "a": "This option is incorrect. A callback function can be called multiple times depending on the logic and design of the higher-order function. It is not limited to being called only once.",
                        "b": "This option is correct. In the context of higher-order functions, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked or called by that function at a specific point or in response to a certain event or condition.",
                        "c": "This option refers to a nested function, which is not necessarily the same as a callback function. While a callback function can be defined inside another function, it is not a requirement. Callback functions can also be defined independently and passed as arguments to other functions.",
                        "d": "This option is incorrect since option b) is the correct explanation for a callback function in the context of higher-order functions."

        "c": "map()",

      },
       "explanations": {
                          "a": "The print() function in Python is not a higher-order function. It is a built-in function used for displaying output to the console. It does not accept or return other functions.",
                          "b": "The len() function in Python is not a higher-order function. It is a built-in function used to determine the length of an object such as a string, list, or tuple. It does not accept or return other functions.",
                          "c": "The map() function in Python is an example of a higher-order function. It takes a function and an iterable as input and applies the function to each element of the iterable, returning an iterator with the results.",
                          "d": "This option is incorrect because print() and len() are not higher-order functions. Only map() is a higher-order function."

       "explanations": {
                          "a": "This statement is not true. Higher-order functions in Python can take other functions as parameters, but they can also take other types of objects as parameters.",
                          "b": "This statement is not true. Higher-order functions can be called by other functions, but they can also be called directly in code.",
                          "c": "This statement is true. Higher-order functions in Python have the ability to take other functions as parameters and/or return a function as a result. This is what distinguishes them as higher-order functions.",

                        "a": "This option is not correct. Decorators in Python are not specifically used for defining and reusing complex functions. They are used to add extra functionality to existing functions.",
                        "b": "This option is correct. Decorators in Python are used to modify or enhance the behavior of existing functions without modifying their original code. They allow you to add extra functionality such as logging, timing, caching, or authentication to functions.",
                        "c": "This option is not correct. Decorators do not create new built-in functions. They are used to modify the behavior of existing functions.",
                        "d": "This option is not correct. Decorators do not convert functions to methods. They are used to enhance the functionality of functions, regardless of whether they are regular functions or methods."
